1. User Registration & Setup
Step 1: Register on Monitr.app

User Action: The user visits Monitr.app and registers by providing basic information (email, company name, etc.).
Outcome: A new user account is created. The system generates a subdomain for the client: ClientCompanyname.monitr.app.
Step 2: Select Billing Plan

User Action: After registration, the user selects a pricing plan (e.g., free for basic features, paid for more integrations and advanced alerting).
Outcome: The user is given access to the platform based on the selected plan. Subscription and billing details are stored securely.
2. Client Connects AWS Account to Monitr
Step 3: Connect AWS Account

User Action: The client is prompted to connect their AWS account to Monitr. This is done by entering an IAM role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) or by using AWS OIDC/SSO for more seamless integration.
Alternatively, Monitr can generate a one-time link to allow users to authorize Monitr’s access to their AWS environment via IAM roles and permissions.
AWS permissions should allow Monitr to pull metrics from EC2, EKS, and other key AWS services.
Outcome: Monitr is granted access to the client's AWS resources. This integration allows Monitr to fetch EC2 and EKS data (and more) for monitoring.
3. Automated Dashboard Creation
Step 4: Dashboard Creation

User Action: Once the AWS account is connected, Monitr automatically scans the client’s AWS environment (e.g., EC2 instances, EKS clusters, etc.) and creates a dashboard for each selected service.
For EC2: Monitr auto-generates a dashboard with metrics like instance health, CPU usage, disk space, and network traffic for each EC2 instance.
For EKS: A dashboard for each EKS cluster is created, displaying pod health, node status, CPU, memory usage, and other key performance indicators.
For other services (e.g., S3, RDS), additional dashboards can be auto-created as needed.
Outcome: The user has a personalized dashboard for their AWS services, which are populated with real-time metrics.
Step 5: Dashboard Customization (Optional)

User Action: The client can choose to customize these dashboards (e.g., add/remove widgets, set up custom views, etc.).
Outcome: A fully customized monitoring dashboard for the client’s infrastructure and applications, tailored to their needs.
4. Monitoring and Alerts
Step 6: Monitoring with Bitemporal Data

Feature: Monitr tracks bitemporal data (data for specific timeframes) for services. For example:
"At this point in time, how many users were using service X?"
This allows users to track historical performance and usage patterns for more accurate reporting and decision-making.
Outcome: Users can visualize metrics not just in real time but also in historical contexts (e.g., over the past hour, day, or week).
Step 7: Set Up Alerts

User Action: Clients can set up alerts for specific thresholds (e.g., if an EC2 instance CPU usage exceeds 80% for 5 minutes, or if an EKS pod enters a "CrashLoopBackOff").
Alert Channels: Alerts can be linked to external systems like PagerDuty, Slack, or email for real-time notifications.
Alert Rules: Users can create complex alerting rules (e.g., send an alert when CPU usage > 80% AND disk space < 10%).
Outcome: Clients are notified about critical events and can take immediate action to resolve issues.
5. Report Generation
Step 8: Generate Reports

User Action: The client can generate reports based on selected metrics and time periods.
Reports can be customized to include specific metrics (e.g., EC2 instance uptime, EKS pod health, overall system performance).
These reports can be exported in various formats (PDF, CSV) for further analysis or to share with stakeholders.
Outcome: The user can easily generate detailed reports that provide insights into the health and performance of their AWS environment.
6. Ongoing Monitoring & Insights
Step 9: Continuous Monitoring

Feature: Once the dashboards, alerts, and reports are set up, Monitr will continuously monitor the AWS infrastructure, providing insights on performance, health, and usage.
The system will keep track of all services and notify the user whenever something goes wrong (e.g., degraded service, system failure).
Outcome: Clients can rely on Monitr for ongoing monitoring without needing to manually check every service or system component.
7. Additional Features (Future Enhancements)
User Action: As the platform grows, additional services could be integrated (e.g., RDS, Lambda, S3).
Outcome: The client’s monitoring system becomes even more comprehensive, tracking the entire AWS ecosystem.
Features Recap:
Bitemporal Data for Monitoring: Users can view service metrics at specific time points (e.g., user count at a given time).
Report Generation: Ability to generate and export reports for various AWS services.
Alerting: Configure custom alerts for services and link them to PagerDuty (or other services) for incident management.
Seamless Integration with AWS: Minimal configuration required to connect to EC2, EKS, and potentially other AWS services.
Easy-to-Use Dashboards: Automatically generated dashboards that can be customized based on user needs.
How This Flow Enhances the User Experience:
Zero-Code Setup: Non-technical users will find it easy to get started with minimal configuration. AWS account integration via IAM roles is seamless and only requires initial credentials.
No-Code Dashboards: Dashboards are automatically created for the connected services, making it simple for users to monitor and visualize their infrastructure without needing to understand complex monitoring tools.
Historical Data for Context: With bitemporal data, users can make more informed decisions, knowing what was happening at specific points in time (e.g., how the system performed during a spike in traffic).
Alerting & Incident Management: Integration with PagerDuty or Slack ensures that users get timely notifications and can act quickly on any critical issues.
